### Description

Updated. Version 1.1.1 (fixed ignore of Friend Properties). This VB Add-In allows E-Z formatting of Procedure headings. I wrote this because of the laziness of fellow developers who saw no sense in taking the time to AT LEAST document a Subroutine or Function or Property (until 6 months down the road when they wish they had).

The Original incarnation of this program was grabbed from the web years and years and years ago (back when I was a “baby” VB developer). I have fleshed it out with a lot of new functionality, simplified a lot of procedures, and cleaned up the code. I wish I could remember who had originally posted the original incarnation of this useful utility.

Anyway, it makes a great beginner project. I did this back in '98 when I was first learning VB (I came over from C++ and Fortran). Oh, since I'm a C++ developer, let me tell you about my fellow bozos who stick their nose up at VB: Once I realized I could write an application in VB in a day that would take me close to a month to do in C++, I became an instant VB convert.
